         <p>The Where's Waldo community knows how difficult it is to lose a member of the family. So our organization has set out to create a helpful database of concerned citizens and other helpful organizations to assist in the search of pets gone missing. The database will allow you to search by zip code or RFID and/or chip number. We also facilitate in finding forever homes for unclaimed pets along with any necessary shots and required documentation. The WWC family is committed to connecting families with the assistance that they need for adoption services</p>
