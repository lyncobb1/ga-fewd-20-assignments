        <h2>About The W.W.C</h2>
         <p>The <b><i>Where's Waldo Community (W.W.C)</i></b> was founded in 2016 to address the need to reconnect families with their lost or stolen pets, connect homeless and neglected animals with forever homes and help prevent the euthanasia of unclaimed and perfectly loveable animals. The WWC also knows how difficult it is to lose a cherished member of the family. So our organization has set out to create a database of concerned citizens and helpful organizations to assist in the search of pets gone missing or assist people looking to grow their families. This database will allow you to search local animal shelters using your local zip code. Should the information you provide match the information in the organizational database, you will be contacted using the information provided.</p>

         <p> The WWC also offers other services regarding pet adoption, dog training, animal chipping and tips toward the overall health and fitness for any type of pet. Just click on the pet registry button above and enter a few details regarding your dog or cat or you may hit the 'Contact Us' button and reach out to us directly. The WWC is available from 8am to 7pm Monday through Friday and 8am to 2pm on Saturdays.</p>
